# Go module cache (usually ~/.cache/go-build)
# This will be created inside your project if you use GOPATH mode or
# if your module cache is configured to be inside your project.
# It is generally safe to ignore, but if you have a specific reason
# to commit it (e.g., for very specific reproducible builds in a monorepo
# with constrained build environments), you might comment this out.
