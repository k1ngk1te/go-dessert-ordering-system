## 1. Overview

This project is a robust and secure web application for a dessert ordering system, built entirely with **Go (Golang)**. It's designed to cater to both traditional web clients (rendering HTML views) and modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) or mobile clients (via a RESTful JSON API). The system provides core functionalities for user management, product Browse, and shopping cart operations, all while prioritizing security and maintainability.

## 2. Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - User Registration and Login (via web forms and JSON API).
  - Secure password hashing (`bcrypt`).
  - **Hybrid Authentication:** Supports both secure server-side sessions (for HTML views using `scs` with Redis) and stateless JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication (for API requests).
  - Secure Logout.
- **Product Management:** Browse available desserts.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add/remove items from a cart.
- **CSRF Protection:** Implemented for all HTML forms to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Flash Messages:** Provides user feedback across redirects (e.g., successful login, error messages).
- **Structured Logging:** Centralized logging for errors and application events.
- **Dependency Injection:** A clear and maintainable way to manage application services and dependencies.

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang):** The primary programming language.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for storing user accounts, products, orders, etc.
- **Redis:** In-memory data store used for session management (`scs`) and caching.
- **`scs` (Secure Cookie Sessions):** For robust, tamper-proof session management in traditional web flows.
- **`golang-jwt/jwt/v5`:** For generating and validating JSON Web Tokens for API authentication.
- **`bcrypt`:** For secure one-way password hashing.
- **`DotEnv`:** For managing environment variables.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For easy setup and management of database and Redis services.

## 4. Architecture & Design Principles

The application adheres to a modular and layered architecture, promoting separation of concerns:

- **Handlers (Controllers):** Handle incoming HTTP requests, delegate logic to services, and render responses (HTML or JSON).
- **Services (Business Logic):** Contain the core business rules and orchestrate interactions between models.
- **Models (Data Access Objects):** Interact directly with the database, abstracting data storage details.
- **Middleware:** Intercepts requests for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and CSRF protection.
- **Dependency Injection:** Services and components are passed as dependencies, enhancing testability and flexibility.

## 5. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.22 or higher.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** (Recommended) For easily setting up MySQL and Redis. Alternatively, you can install and configure them manually.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# Application Port
PORT=8080

# Database Configuration (MySQL)
DB_DSN="user:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/dessert_db?parseTime=true"
# Example if using Docker Compose:
# DB_DSN="user:password@tcp(mysql:3306)/dessert_db?parseTime=true"

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_ADDR="localhost:6379"
# Example if using Docker Compose:
# REDIS_ADDR="redis:6379"
REDIS_PASSWORD="" # Leave empty if no password
REDIS_DB=0

# JWT Secret Key (for JSON Web Tokens)
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your_very_long_and_random_jwt_secret_key"

# Application Domain (e.g., for cookie security)
APP_DOMAIN="localhost"
```
